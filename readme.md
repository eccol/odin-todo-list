This is an assignment for The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-todo-list

The goal is to create a todo list entirely in Javascript.

Current status:  
* Can add and remove projects and their sub-tasks.  
* Can toggle tasks as complete.
* Can save to localstorage.

Left to do:  
* Allow updating task and project information.  
* All of the styling. So much styling.
