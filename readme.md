This is an assignment for The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-todo-list

The goal is to create a todo list entirely in Javascript.

Current status: Can add and remove projects and their sub-tasks. Can toggle tasks as complete.

Left to do:  
* Make the due dates actual dates.  
* Allow updating task and project information.  
* All of the styling. So much styling.
